Foundations of Programming: Python

University of Washington

Professor: Randal Root

Assignment 07


**Introduction**

For this assignment 7, we are to use the web to research good examples of websites for pickling and error handling in python. We are then to explain the subject and why we feel these websites are good. We are then to post our assignment on GitHub, create a GitHub webpage, and take the text, images, and links from your Word document and put them into the GitHub webpage.

**Assignment**

For this assignment, I use the web to research Exception Handling and Error Handling in Python. I have organized this paper to showcase the few webpages that provide good example to learn these topics. And to explain why I chose them. I also added examples that I have learn from these websites to explain the topic. 

**Research Exception Handling in Python**

I found these four webpages below on except handling exceptionally good. To me, what is a good website for teaching anything, let alone programming, is to start with the very extreme basic. A good website will not confuse the student with additional information that is unnecessary at the beginning. They will use as minimal of information as possible to get their point across. A good website will also use multiple simple examples to augment their point. A good website must also go through each step carefully because skipping a step may confuse the student. Therefore, I found these websites to be good, especially the first one on the list from w3wschools.com. What is exceptionally good about w3wschool.com is that they also format their webpages so that they are very easy to read, with lots of white spaces and large fonts and good use of background color to separate the different examples:
